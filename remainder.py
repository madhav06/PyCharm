# python 3

# There is a single operator in Python, capable of providing the remainder of a division operation. 
# Two numbers are passed as parameters. The first parameter divided by the second parameter will have a remainder, 
# possibly zero. Return that value.

#remainder(1, 3) ➞ 1

#remainder(3, 4) ➞ 3

#remainder(5, 5) ➞ 0

#remainder(7, 2) ➞ 1

def remainder(x, y):
	#return (x%y)
	print(x%y)


remainder(1, 3)

remainder(3, 4)

remainder(5, 5)
