# # In computer science, "recursion" is the act of writing a function that calls itself from within its own code. 
# # The function below better helps explain and illustrate recursion by simply counting down from a given number to zero:




# code:

def factorial(num):
 if (num<=1):
  return 1
 else:
 	zelda = 
  return (num*factorial(num-1))

factorial(5)
